    The objective of this project was to develop a script that leverages the ChatGPT API to generate erroneous code samples, including linker errors, semantic errors, and other types of code faults. These generated code samples were used to create a dataset for training an NLP model, aimed at improving the model's ability to identify, classify, and potentially rectify various types of coding errors. This project was conducted in collaboration with a PhD student, contributing to their research in the field of natural language processing and software engineering. The ultimate goal was to enhance the NLP model's capability to assist developers in diagnosing and resolving coding issues more efficiently.

    In software development, identifying and resolving errors such as linker and semantic errors is a crucial yet time-consuming task. To improve this process, a project was undertaken to develop a script using the ChatGPT API to generate erroneous code samples automatically. These samples, which simulate real-world coding issues, were used to create a dataset for training an NLP model aimed at enhancing automated error detection and resolution. This effort, conducted in collaboration with a PhD student, contributes to advancing NLP tools in software engineering by providing a comprehensive dataset to train models to better identify and fix coding errors.

An initial prompt to engage Chat Gpt. The role has to be user with conditions:

- The prompt has to be very precise.
- Make sure the prompt has condition of no duplication.
- Check in the terminal to see if the output meets the condtions of what you are looking for.
    
- Check the example below:
        
        "Let's start fresh. We need to clear your chat entirely. I'm working on creating a dataset based on faulty code. Specifically, I'm interested in runtime errors known as Linker Errors. Your task is to provide me with various examples of this type of error, written in .cpp format. To ensure a clean dataset for the machine learning model, we need a diverse range of examples that are clear and complete in terms of code structure. When I say 'next,' please provide me with an example code that triggers the Linker error, without any additional information. I dont need comments in the code. It's crucial to avoid duplicating any code you've already provided. Please only give me the code examples and refrain from offering explanations about the code ‚Äì this is important. If you understand the instructions, please respond with a simple 'yes,' without any additional text."
