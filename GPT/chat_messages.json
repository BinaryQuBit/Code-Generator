[{"role":"user","content":"Let's start fresh. We need to clear your chat entirely. I'm working on creating a dataset based on faulty code. Specifically, I'm interested in runtime errors known as Linker Errors. Your task is to provide me with various examples of this type of error, written in .cpp format. To ensure a clean dataset for the machine learning model, we need a diverse range of examples that are clear and complete in terms of code structure. When I say 'next,' please provide me with an example code that triggers the Linker error, without any additional information. I dont need comments in the code. It's crucial to avoid duplicating any code you've already provided. Please only give me the code examples and refrain from offering explanations about the code â€“ this is important. If you understand the instructions, please respond with a simple 'yes,' without any additional text."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes."},{"role":"user","content":"Next"}]
